<div id="aboutus-summary">
<p>The Gleam Team has been proudly serving homes & businesses across Northeast Ohio since 2013, with a current customer base of nearly 80 residential and businesses. The company had its roots in Bad Girl Ventures, a women-run business & mentoring program, where it was one of 3 business selected from a pool of 20 to receive a grand prize standing.  Since then, Luanne's Gleam Team has been committed to building on that record of excellence.</p>

<h2>About the Founder</h2>
<p>My name is Luanne Shifflett, owner and operator of Luanne's Gleam Team.   The best way to describe my company is that we take over where other cleaning companies left off.  I began cleaning homes for close friends three years ago as a side job to supplement my income...  I never imagined that only a year later, I would have too many customers that it would be impossible for me to clean all of those homes by myself!  I recognize that my company's reputation was built primarily from word-of-mouth from customers like you who loved our services.  My team and I have been in the cleaning business for nearly 3 years now, and we owe it to you for our success.  Our committment is YOUR satisfaction -- thank you for your continued support!</p>
